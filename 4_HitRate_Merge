# 1. Video coding information?----
# mean task duration differs between conditions (ANOVA)
# mean glance time differs between conditions (ANOVA)
# how much does eyes off road differ between conditions (ANOVA)
# number of glances per unit time between conditions (ANOVA)

# 2. DRT information?----
# create a model to see what is driving hit rate? 
# (is it glance time, eyes off road, or frequency?)
# this tells us A: is RDRT a good surrogate measure of eyeglances? 
# B: what aspects of glance behavior does it measure?

# 3. How is hit rate associated with glance time? (collapse across conditions??) ----
# a. generate a sweet scatterplot
# b. is there an appropriate analysis for this?
